1 5 stars all the way ! .
1 3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .
1 it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
1 the ss body is wonderful , feels high-quality .
1 it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .
0 always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
1 this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
0 first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made .
1 cuts are easy and smooth .
0 first , it serious , serious installation problems .
1 it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket .
1 its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market .
0 i haven 't seen any problems yet , but if you don 't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up .
1 all in all , this is a wonderful device .
0 there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .
0 basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help .
1 the card basically installed itself and the " install wizard " on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) .
1 it holds plenty of songs .
1 and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 . 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge .
1 i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .
1 great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? . ) . . . the 2 . 0 megapixel one ) .
1 what i really like about- its quite , it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking .
1 canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
0 the biggest problem is the installation .
0 this product is too fragile for normal use .
1 2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
0 so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
1 so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .
1 it 's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great .
1 very small .
1 we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $6 . 00 for a year of bags- can 't beat that ! . ! .
0 then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone .
0 they really are awfully small .
1 the camera was a marvel .
1 the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus .
1 its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .
1 i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
0 -user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website .
0 the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function .
0 tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
1 speed is not a problem .
1 the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
1 i am very pleased with it so far .
0 so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .
0 buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .
0 for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .
1 the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick .
1 it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
1 i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho ) .
1 i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
0 all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift .
1 basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used .
0 you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
1 other plusses : changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
1 built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .
1 it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well .
0 for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .
0 the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application .
1 colors : 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from .
1 - large easy readable screen
1 the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
0 you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu .
1 the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
1 sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected .
1 for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
1 it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .
1 some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .
1 if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
0 for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the caribbean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
1 i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
0 ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
1 while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .
1 it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
1 the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
1 i 've had no problems w/ this phone .
0 1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
1 i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it .
0 the karma is only $5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog .
0 it still smelled .
1 took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
1 a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with .
1 the sound quality is also nice . . . after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
1 my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
0 ) creative , inc . the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices .
1 canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
1 manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
1 it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .
0 it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
1 given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
1 this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
1 i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $$$ , it was definitely worth it .
1 much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
1 it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
1 the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; . see below ) .
0 it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70% of my calls using it .
1 the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .
0 one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
1 and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .
1 one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well .
1 you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i . e . free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps / games .
0 it 's not the heaviest around ( i think porter-cable has that distinction ) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation .
1 plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
1 great phone . . .
0 it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
1 the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
0 secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .
0 it is not reliable .
0 this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .
0 the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
1 a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .
1 memory/storage - seemingly boundless .
1 well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry .
1 i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product ! .
0 buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks .
0 if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else .
1 the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! .
1 the other controls are all very easy to use .
0 the gprs web access is slow ! .
1 price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
0 i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
1 this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device .
1 in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room .
1 i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
1 the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
0 - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
0 the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
1 4 . play n-gage games on it .
1 record memos using the built in microphone .
0 another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up .
1 songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .
1 if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice .
1 good image quality .
1 it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! .
0 doesn 't have alot of good games on it .
1 you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
1 the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use .
0 this is extremely lame .
0 although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there .
0 the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
1 i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
1 the features are really cool like the radio .
1 the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
1 i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
1 you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
1 camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution .
1 if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else .
1 but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
1 no down time , great signal strength .
1 an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook .
1 sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .
0 now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again .
1 still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! .
0 t610 supports only midi files .
1 has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great .
0 the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed .
0 if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth .
0 the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n 't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
0 too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! .
1 great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! . ! . ! .
0 they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
1 the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal .
1 this player is an ideal purchase .
0 do not buy this product --
1 player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
1 we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great .
0 my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful .
1 the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
1 the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great ! .
1 i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .
0 1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! . somethings wrong with the dvd player ! . come quick ! . "
0 the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple .
1 with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
1 what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
1 the diaper champ is the best we found ! .
1 but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! .
1 the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent .
1 also , you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue , dammit ! . but itunes is about as good as anything .
1 first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .
0 next , the big reason not to buy any norton product : if there 's a problem with it , norton charges $30 to even tell them about it .
0 anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants .
1 i think the interface is great .
1 just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time .
1 this one is full of features ( has bluetooth ) .
0 4 . the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
0 i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits .
1 this thing does everything but washes your dishes .
0 but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes .
1 the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod .
1 the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
1 i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
1 great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great .
0 the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
1 i 'm really happy with this purchase .
1 looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
1 the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use .
1 i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice .
1 however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
1 the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
1 naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recommend www . no madness . net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
0 only 1 problem , no accessories . . . yet .
1 2 . take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures .
0 if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while .
1 fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd
1 i love the bluetooth ; . easy to use with a wireless abra headset .
0 the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
1 why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ? .
0 the grain was terrible .
0 in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
1 the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .
1 i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
1 learning how to use it will not take very long .
1 this one has a good looking .
0 now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! .
0 the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of " ear buds " .
1 while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets .
1 1 ) the champ is easy to use .
0 i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky .
1 the size of the camera is perfect .
1 i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
1 sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
1 our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
1 received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
1 i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it .
1 feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there .
1 7 . have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone .
1 if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer .
1 you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3-player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! . ! . ) and also you can carry it in your pocket : ) .
1 i am really impressed by this dvd player .
1 ) one outstanding positive feature is the battery . it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup .
0 it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers .
1 transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .
0 there was neither picture nor sound .
1 it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
1 i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
1 the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
0 though nearly a dozen different people at both t-mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices .
1 i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
0 the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .
1 even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
1 we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it .
1 i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
0 the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! .
0 if you have an older version of " internet security " installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .
1 it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills .
1 the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
1 upside : this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ) .
1 the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .
0 the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
0 as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears .
0 i tried called apex cu st service , no help .
1 right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .
1 i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .
1 this one is really great .
1 n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc .
0 even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up .
0 one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
1 for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
1 this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
0 for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that .
0 however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off .
0 i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
0 because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .
1 i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
1 it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i don 't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable .
1 the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone .
1 i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .
0 so , right out of the box i had issue .
0 so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! .
0 
1 this really is a great little phone ; . its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! .
0 the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un-soiled they are .
1 i really love this phone . . .
1 now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .
0 the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding .
1 after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .
0 cons - difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor .
1 it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
1 i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
0 however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release .
1 great features . . .
1 all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
0 the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
0 who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95 ? . ( i also bought the back-up cd ) .
1 but , for the money it is a good machine .
1 without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! .
1 it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried .
1 the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
1 well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more .
1 but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
0 recently the variable speed control went out .
0 the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
1 as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .
1 it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work .
1 for the price and features it is really good .
0 some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
1 personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .
0 the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
1 they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact .
1 most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery .
0 very annoying .
0 the battery life can 't be very long ; . let 's not be greedy .
1 the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
1 like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
0 right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly .
0 i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers . . . not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc .
1 apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc .
0 i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
0 ( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked .
1 wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .
0 this dvd play is basically junk .
1 2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon's .
1 it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .
1 ( we wrap them nice and tight ) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags -- cheap ! .
1 8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes ) .
1 the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
1 it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
0 if you do n 't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
1 i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! .
1 - uploading music is quick and easy .
1 the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .
0 the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .
1 extremely convenient .
1 and it holds so much music and audio files .
0 the only reason for not giving it 5 stars : the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6-8 hours at most .
0 both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
1 - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
1 using supplied s/w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it .
1 if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you ! .
1 it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
0 the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .
0 you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
1 by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .
0 the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .
1 but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . . .
1 the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly ) .
1 the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
0 the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that .
0 but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
0 for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .
0 was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac .
1 this camera is bulletproof .
0 the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
1 this phone is one of the best i 've ever used .
1 this is the best phone i have seen .
1 i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking ) .
0 another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging[-2]
0 i couldn 't get the install wizard to work .
1 this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
1 excellent diaper disposal unit .
0 yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable .
0 cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality .
1 its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 . . . so with all that said , buy the router ! . ! . ! . ! .
1 i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
1 no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor . '
0 the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
1 i would recommend this product to anyone .
0 while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch .
1 the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery .
1 the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
1 i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing .
1 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
1 linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding .
1 another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; . the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
1 and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow .
0 less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "
0 p . s . the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port . the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power ; . after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly .
1 all the " cool " features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 .
1 +sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc . . . it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .
1 it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
0 the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480 .
1 not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
1 overall , a good buy for the price .
0 at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated .
1 i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance .
0 if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way ! .
1 we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers .
0 it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .
0 it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
1 i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .
0 the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so .
1 great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
0 also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
0 seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .
0 the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
0 there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10-20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners .
0 why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? . ? . ? .
1 great design -- very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( virtual ones are the only competition ) ; . and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus .
1 the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .
0 the product also leaves a faint smell in the room .
1 it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house .
1 2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception .
0 the touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player .
0 i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
1 6 . play game boy color games on it with go boy .
0 the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
0 of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident .
1 one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
1 the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
1 for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod .
1 many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks .
1 i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest .
0 second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating .
0 both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best .
1 overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s/w worked well to connect .
1 ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
0 only problem is that is a bit heavy .
1 but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! .
1 its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
1 i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless-g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product .
1 2 ) storage capacity
1 sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good .
0 it wo n 't play all of my movies .
1 i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great .
1 it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! . ) .
1 it has a nice color screen .
1 this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit .
1 it is crystal clear .
1 the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription ! .
0 seems the " program scan " feature did not find the exe file for outlook ! .
0 also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones .
1 the bass is deep and the treble is clear .
1 it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges .
0 the vibration is not top .
1 it 's so cute . . . and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue .
1 i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
1 when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! .
1 i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
1 we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! .
1 if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player .
1 i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .
1 the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
1 your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .
0 when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked -- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks -- useless .
1 way less expensive than the ipod .
1 a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer :
0 even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track .
0 but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design .
0 again , this is a design flaw in the headphone ! .
0 ) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star : what 's up with no recharge cord ? .
1 they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great .
1 it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! .
1 i recently had to run a 3/4 " straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn 't even slow down .
1 there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
1 and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
0 navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
0 * eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files .
1 it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
1 battery life is good for a phone of this size .
1 +battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality . . . i mean it is creative right ? .
1 the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .
0 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
1 this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
1 i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v .
0 like other reviewers , installation was hell .
1 it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
1 even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
1 power for the tech-savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate .
0 when the player was working it was great , but .
1 it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .
1 i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue .
1 my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not " whine " during video , and my pictures are razor sharp .
1 the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness .
1 i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .
1 the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
1 as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep .
0 two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well .
1 better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .
0 only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
0 unfortunately i was wrong .
0 where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ) .
1 the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual .
1 good quality video .
0 at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
0 as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! .
0 other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better .
1 they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thus far ) .
0 it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless .
1 the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
1 however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter .
1 i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 . it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
0 the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
1 with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
1 sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
0 - some features in the user interface
0 unfortunately , the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it .
0 the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
1 this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon . never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
1 with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
1 3 ) 4x zoom is nice
0 also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! . ) and so does the smell of their diapers ! .
1 it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers .
1 - excellent sound quality
1 ( you can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby . ) also , we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the diaper genie ) .
1 it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
0 what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .
1 the phone itself is pretty nice .
0 i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time .
1 photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one . . even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
1 you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
1 the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; . there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to .
0 the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder .
1 also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
0 configuring it for a home network was almost impossible .
1 besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! .
1 i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything .
1 along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features .
0 i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it .
1 this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4-5 megapixel .
1 i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior .
0 my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made .
0 the interface took a little getting used to .
0 the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will .
0 i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out- well , just be prepared .
0 the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having .
0 cons : no am/fm radio tuner -- something a large number of compete tors are doing
1 actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .
0 i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .
1 6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
1 fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .
1 they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic's and sennheisers .
1 moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .
1 the player is great .
1 the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
1 the camera has a wonderful set of features .
0 the touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want .
0 the software sucks .
1 this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr / cadre / dvd / dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the giff , progressive scan feature .
0 f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course
1 its compact and has rounded edges .
1 also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy .
0 negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
1 overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood* .
1 also , very light and portable .
1 the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent .
0 this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! . ! .
1 - well-backlit keypad
1 i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special " diaper " trash bags necessary .
0 to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; . however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
1 i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again .
1 you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .
0 one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
0 3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
1 no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .
0 1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
1 this linksys router does it for the right price .
1 this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .
1 for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .
1 this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
0 it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus .
1 hold button -- suprisingly not all mp3s have this ; . this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket .
1 having the digic ii chip helps a lot .
0 2 ) phone is awfully slow .
0 the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
1 the price / performance looked just right .
1 in conclusion , this player is beautiful .
1 in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
1 this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .
0 about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
1 also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .
1 the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
0 i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked .
1 drops and strong signals even from the backyard .
0 in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless .
1 this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example .
0 their site offers no live help at all .
0 after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me $40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty ) .
0 unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
1 reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
1 with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .
1 i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
0 also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable .
1 the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
0 i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
1 the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .
0 stay away from this product ! .
0 the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac .
0 i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone .
1 the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .
1 the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
1 initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .
0 only con i can think of is no camera . . . .
1 2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .
1 the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
0 a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go . . the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it .
1 the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
1 if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter .
1 5 . the price is right .
1 i am very pleased so far .
0 the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10% or so .
0 start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .
1 all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one .
0 headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
0 what a disappointment ! .
1 itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site .
1 yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
1 the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t-mobile .
0 p . s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? .
1 the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
0 the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight .
1 it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack . . . char ! .
1 i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .
0 when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .
1 ease of use/design : the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one .
1 it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite .
0 the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel
1 i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else .
1 progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
0 i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .
0 if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! . the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .
1 it all sounds great too .
1 overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
1 and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .
1 i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it .
0 the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full .
1 1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
1 the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch .
1 i simply love this feature .
1 the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
1 the metal housing seems very rugged .
1 i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
0 there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the " knowledge " database at linksys . com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult -- that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own .
1 the extra gb is just a bonus .
1 this phone is a winner . . .
1 you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .
0 after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support . . . . they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful .
1 if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now .
1 this is really a nice diaper pail .
1 i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .
1 it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
0 also , the lens cap design is flawed .
0 after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
0 hard drive screws up occasionally
1 controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
0 there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive .
1 the 6600 has more amenities than most - world phone , camera ( vga/zoom/night mode/timer ) , video ( w/ audio & zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more .
0 2 ) scroll button / switch
1 in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! .
1 the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera .
0 this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
1 3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider .
0 this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 ! .
1 the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
1 in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
1 best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
1 goes ~3 days after a charge .
1 *holds the odor in nicely ! .
0 however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
1 i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
1 i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
0 the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
1 the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
1 i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper ; . and i needed to be able to use wma files .
1 i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book ! .
0 creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked .
0 so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .
0 you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right .
0 - the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .
0 styling/ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing .
1 autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
0 i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it .
0 with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on/off controls ) .
0 scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
1 the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! . )
1 go for the champ .
0 as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the " plunger " to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full .
1 with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .
1 don 't worry this player rocks .
1 it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
1 we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .
0 of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless .
1 range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
1 this is a great camera for you ! .
1 this phone has the best battery , it lasts longer then my old 3210
1 the sound is very nice .
1 i 'd say that this camera is perfect .
1 while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .
1 the interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus .
0 i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .
1 the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
1 one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
1 the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
1 overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )
0 it does take some getting used to .
1 i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
0 apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
0 i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
0 the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad .
0 apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone .
1 because of it 's hidden features ( no macro vision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
1 this is a must have product for all new moms ! .
1 i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic ) .
1 nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
0 3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
1 i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! .
1 i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen .
0 have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital . com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
1 the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
0 the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 . 11b speeds and not 802 . 11g .
1 another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .
0 i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .
0 about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
1 the player is smaller than you think .
0 nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
0 after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .
1 3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
0 second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
1 it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
0 only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
1 the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
1 i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .
0 5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
1 clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! . ! . ! .
1 and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3/smtp e-mail account .
0 this thing is trash .
1 sound : this is where i love zen the most .
1 but the product is elf is great .
1 this is an excellent router for the money .
0 then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .
0 but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function .
1 i also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .
1 if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! . highly recommended .
1 this is one of the best purchases we made .
0 opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .
0 and man . . . i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player . . . because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title . .
0 one complaint . . . the screen is too easily scratched ! .
1 it has a classic design yet looks hip .
0 the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
1 overall , this product is awesome .
0 downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .
1 this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .
1 the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid .
1 give each friend a different ringtone .
0 - the software that came with it was tough to load .
1 4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
1 the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features .
1 and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills .
0 after @ 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
1 so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
1 as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains .
1 - the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't .
0 from day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , long shutdowns due to " cc app . exe " program running which is a norton program .
1 t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .
0 and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .
0 many of our disney movies do n 't play on this dvd player .
1 the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
1 the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $135 ! .
1 i have the black one and adore it .
1 really happy with this little camera .
1 it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
0 i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
1 i love my new nomad , its great ! .
1 the image quality is excellent .
1 many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
0 what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
