1 it also works just fine for international calls .
1 2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
1 as for bluetooth , no problems at all .
0 i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .
0 however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every-day use .
0 at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
1 the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use .
1 8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth .
1 nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .
1 all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
1 the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
1 but for what i do use it is perfect .
1 connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! .
0 the " movies " last about 5 seconds .
1 a digic ii-powered image-processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start-up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition .
1 even with the waterproof housing it is small .
1 - replaceable battery .
0 but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
0 is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .
1 well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
1 for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .
0 the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
1 i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine .
0 i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage .
0 it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .
1 the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
1 second , it is incredibly easy to use .
1 nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www . crazy cellphone . com
1 utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list .
0 we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used .
1 software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )
1 regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go .
1 by the way , it looks nice also .
1 the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10 , it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast .
1 the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
0 the door would not close .
1 reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing .
0 too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .
1 if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design .
1 overall build quality , good macros-results , impressive video-quality , good pictures with flash ( good colours , sharp results ) , excellent auto white balance .
1 then sorting the files is easy as pie .
0 the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
1 the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive .
1 for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
1 for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .
1 as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .
1 the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
1 overall , i am very pleased with it .
0 the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
1 great camera .
1 the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users .
1 third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
1 its well made and user friendly .
1 * price and capacity
0 even the instruction booklet is out of order .
0 i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .
1 the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .
1 lastly , the price is fantastic :
1 oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
1 the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
0 it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )
1 there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router .
0 the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
1 this thing seriously is a good player though .
0 enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
1 i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
1 the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
1 first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
0 finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .
1 please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
1 the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc . , are endless .
1 the file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use .
0 the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
0 well , my second one is now beginning to hi cup a bit after about 1 1/2 years .
0 the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
1 this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time .
0 i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone .
1 it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
1 i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
1 i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .
1 despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! .
0 poor visibility on the keys .
1 try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
0 - the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people . -
1 the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .
1 i love the slim design ; . the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky .
1 i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .
1 other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans .
1 it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .
1 these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one .
1 having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
1 ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .
1 we are overall pleased with product .
1 and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .
1 as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
0 i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the " sliding wrench " which comes on the router .
1 it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .
1 i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .
1 lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
1 5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
1 and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
0 the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
1 it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is .
0 in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
0 if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to .
0 player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
1 i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless .
1 i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155 .
1 there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
1 a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
1 even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life ! .
1 lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
1 however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes .
0 there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to .
1 everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .
1 it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .
0 each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
0 a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
1 what i like the most : - small and solid feel .
1 this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .
1 the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server .
1 it fits in your pocket .
1 my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! .
0 it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .
0 other than that it is all the same except the new updates .
1 the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .
0 it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
1 i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs .
1 interface - practically seamless .
1 it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! .
0 is not as intuitive as i would like .
1 the bottom line is " phone is cool one - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones " .
1 it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .
1 i really liked the price . . .
0 it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
1 if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .
0 symantec should give us all a refund and apology ! .
1 i highly recommend this phone .
0 there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n 't moving in time to the dialog ) .
0 i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window .
1 neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings .
0 you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ) .
0 - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
1 the m12v has been great .
1 all of this said [as it 's on it 's way back to amazon] , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod .
1 anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
0 shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking .
0 one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
1 when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage .
1 with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones .
0 cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
0 as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
1 pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
0 just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .
0 you can " disable " some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled -- they 're still there and running .
0 the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
0 it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .
1 i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
1 it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
0 the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned .
1 you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .
1 putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .
1 it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
1 whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! .
1 i 've had nothing but good luck with t-mobile .
1 the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it .
0 and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative .
1 seems to work great .
0 norton support is completely pathetic .
1 ) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .
1 i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the
1 this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; . it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
0 software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it , it does the job well .
1 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
0 navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
0 but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
1 i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers .
1 no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .
1 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings .
1 - looks sleek , compact , has a radio .
0 we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless .
0 -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
1 i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality .
1 it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we 've ever tested .
0 after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
0 i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
1 this is a great product ! .
0 it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
0 i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
1 you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
0 bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature . . . but not on this player . . .
0 knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .
0 the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately .
0 these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .
0 the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; . not sensitive enough at others .
1 the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients .
1 the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
1 there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth .
1 the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up .
1 all in all suprisingly easy to use .
1 i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .
1 all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
1 replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
1 so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
1 the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
0 the tech support is worthless too .
0 navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
0 now the bad : 1 ) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usu age .
0 the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth .
1 i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
1 i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
0 creative software stinks .
1 it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a " normal " compression mode . and , it has the 3x zoom .
0 sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
1 overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
1 i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ) .
0 even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer .
0 i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
1 this is a nice feature ( i . e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .
1 speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! .
1 i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .
1 the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .
1 it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside .
1 so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation ! .
0 this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
1 the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
0 the only problem is the size of the keys .
1 the interface is simple to use .
1 don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .
1 i love the es based controls and easy menus .
0 but the earbuds suck ! .
0 on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative .
1 with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more .
1 it has many great features and very few bad ones .
0 my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .
1 also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
1 i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .
0 sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 . 0 " adjust levels " function . . . not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though .
0 i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
0 2 . you still have to clean the thing ! . ! .
1 i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face .
1 it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .
0 fm receiver - it has none .
1 the fit and finish of the product is first-rate .
1 the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
1 plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great .
0 there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! .
1 it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
1 i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
1 the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! .
1 a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
0 buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .
1 pick your favorite color and buy it .
0 the battery , as others have said , also seems weaker than creative suggests .
1 take quick pictures with excelent resolution
0 maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it .
1 it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow .
1 the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ? .
0 the included memory card is too small .
1 i must have gotten a good one .
1 handset quality is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality .
0 first off , the battery .
1 can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .
1 the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
1 it works easily with one hand , which is important .
1 it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .
0 they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
1 i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt . com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps/directions into it , which is great .
1 handsfree future is good , but not too exciting .
1 can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
1 it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket .
1 on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well .
1 the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too . ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby .
1 no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .
1 they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .
1 it is mindless to operate .
0 luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger .
0 unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
1 the moveable lcd screen is great .
1 the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
1 it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch .
1 this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
0 i then realized a major design flaw .
1 oh . . . and file transfers are fast & easy .
1 this is an excellent router for the price .
1 there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .
1 the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog .
1 otherwise , this player is awesome ! .
0 the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
1 it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ? .
1 i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
1 all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .
1 i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .
1 and it is very easy to clean .
1 the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .
0 i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time ! .
1 camera is a paper weight .
1 but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! .
0 apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
0 i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
0 overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion .
1 the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other niceties , that you would enjoy .
0 also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up .
1 another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers .
0 screen review could be better .
1 diaper champ is great .
1 so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .
0 this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine .
1 it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
1 simple and it works ! .
0 creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
1 with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive .
1 sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention . . . the sound quality is excellent ! .
1 it works great .
0 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
1 big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 " is enough
0 the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile .
0 respectable , solid , but not awe-inspiring .
0 i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
1 i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
1 versatile and stylish .
1 its really cool .
0 well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
1 for the most part this is a good dvd player .
1 the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
0 it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
1 you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! . ) .
1 1 . the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer .
1 the in ital setup of the router was simple .
1 first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc .
0 the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
1 the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! .
0 i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
1 it was no problem for me to use their software .
1 the fm radio is cool .
1 ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .
1 the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster .
1 the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack .
0 the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken .
0 seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
1 everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .
1 exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .
1 - great sound ! . i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones .
0 i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and saw no improvement .
0 it seems like the software is just not responding .
1 whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .
0 there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows .
0 while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
1 ( it sure does look nice , though ! . ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere : the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge ! .
0 i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help .
1 the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface .
1 the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .
0 and supply those stupid white headphones .
1 i prefer things that are simple .
1 once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor ) .
1 they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
1 using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod .
1 it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .
1 but it ; . you won 't regret it .
0 i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .
1 overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .
1 could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over iso100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefact's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video-playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight .
1 however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
1 - light , compact design
1 it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever .
1 if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one .
0 diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first .
0 1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectors s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
1 well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! .
0 on my main computer the software did not work right .
1 it feels tiny in the hand without it .
0 there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .
1 great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc .
1 for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
1 i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet .
0 it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .
0 i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
0 after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( flor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them . the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
